# DeltaNotes: Personal Mathematics Notebook

A collection of my personal handwritten notes and explorations in mathematics, focused on linear algebra and numerical methods. This is for my own reference and occasional sharing with fellow enthusiasts—think of it as a digital sketchbook from my MSc and PhD days.

## Quick Background
Just some notes from my studies:
- MSc in Mathematics: Covered core undergrad topics like linear algebra (matrices, eigenvalues) and analysis.
- PhD in Mechanical Engineering: Specialized in numerical methods for acoustics and vibration (e.g., FEM/BEM for wave equations like Helmholtz).
- Fun fact: About 80% of North American undergrad math feels like home turf; still tinkering with probabilities and functional analysis (Sobolev spaces, etc.).

These are casual jottings to keep the math muscles sharp—no big projects, just problem-solving vibes.

## **Quick Example: ASCII Math Snippet**
For fun, here's a simple eigenvalue calc in text form (from a 2x2 matrix A = [[m, 1], [-1, m]]):  
Characteristic eq: det(A - λI) = (m - λ)^2 + 1 = 0  
→ λ = m ± i  
(Imaginary roots = oscillatory stability – cool for wave sims!)

## What's Inside
- **Handwritten_Calcs.pdf** (password-protected): Scanned pages of step-by-step workings.
  - Examples: Parameterized 2x2 matrices (invertibility, eigenvalues), stability in oscillatory systems, and quick sketches for acoustic simulations.
  - *Password: Kept private—DM if you're a math buddy and want a peek!*
- **CV_Summary.pdf**: A slim resume snippet on my math/engineering path (no full deets, just the highlights).

## Notes for Myself (or Curious Readers)
- Equations are in plain text/ASCII for simplicity (e.g., lambda = m ± i for complex eigenvalues).
- Inspired by classic problems—great for brushing up on undergrad stuff.

## **Ongoing Ideas**
- **Probabilities tweak**: Exploring binomial distributions for signal noise models (e.g., P(success) = p^k * (1-p)^{n-k}).
- **Combinatorics notes**: Permutations in array configs – n! ways to arrange m mics? Fun puzzle.
- **Tool tip**: Using Mathpix for OCR on scans to LaTeX (handy for clean exports).
