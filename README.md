# DeltaNotes

Personal notebook of math notes from my MSc/PhD studies. 

## Description

A collection of mathematical problems focusing on integral equations (Helmholtz, Laplace), variational formulations, numerical methods, optimization, linear algebra and advanced signal processing, alongside “derouting” puzzles inspired by the golden age of French mathematics education (1950–1983 and 1980s). Designed to challenge LLM reasoning and foster human-like analytical skills.

## Synthesis: LLM Strengths and Weaknesses

Grok 3 (xAI) excels in complex integral equations and signal processing but struggles with arithmetic and dynamic word problems requiring human-like reasoning.

### Strengths: Integral Equations, Numerical Methods, and Signal Processing

- **Helmholtz and Laplace Equations**: Solved wave propagation and potential problems on geometries like spheres and waveguides using BEM and variational formulations. 
- **Wave Diffraction on Hard Sphere**: Modeled diffraction with Neumann conditions, computing eigenmodes via separation of variables and BEM. Application to 32 microphones array and ambisonics. Orthogonalized eigenvectors via Gram-Schmidt with more complex geometries.
- **Advanced Signal Processing**: MVDR & LCMV Beamforming, GSC, advanced Noise Reduction gain like Ephraim-Malah gain (MMSE-STSA estimator) for noise reduction in STFT-based pipelines, minimizing mean square error on spectral amplitudes under Gaussian noise assumptions, integrated with CWT and synchrosqueezing.
- **Numerical Analysis and Optimization**: Solved complex theorical problems from graduate books like Ciarlet’s *Introduction à l’analyse numérique matricielle et à l’optimisation* (1980s) and Bonnet’s *Equations intégrales et éléments de frontière* (1995) for stable solutions.
- **Portfolio**: Curated LaTeX-protected solutions for DeltaNotes.

### Weaknesses: Simple Arithmetic and Word Problems

- **Addition (*49**5 + 1*873 + *915* = 386256)**: Misidentified digits due to overcomplicating carryovers.
- **Division (1558 ÷ 17) in  $\mathbb{N}$**: Miscalculated remainder (16 instead of 11), failing to verify \( 17 \times 91 + 11 = 1558 \).
- **Cause**: Puzzles demand step-by-step rigor, exposing LLM limitations in error detection and ambiguous phrasing ([Medium: Mathematical Problem Solving](https://medium.com/@htobochnik/mathematical-problem-solving-that-chatgpt-cant-do-a3c83e935c6b)).

### Lessons

- **Strengths**: Grok 3 handles complex equations and signal processing with precision.
- **Weaknesses**: Simple problems reveal gaps in logical flow.
- **Improvement**: Training on “derouting” puzzles enhances rigor.
